The dataset includes 2398 images.
Bat-ball-stumps-batsman-bowler are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -13 and +13 degrees
* Random shear of between -7째 to +7째 horizontally and -8째 to +8째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -18 and +18 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -9 and +9 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.9 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -11 and +11 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -7 and +7 percent
