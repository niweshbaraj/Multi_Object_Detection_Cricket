# Outputs Directory

This directory contains the results generated by the cricket multi-object detection system.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ demo_frames/
Sample detection frames showing the model's performance on cricket videos:
- Color-coded bounding boxes for different cricket objects
- Confidence scores and class labels
- Representative frames from different camera angles

### üìÅ heatmaps/
Position heatmaps showing movement patterns:
- `ball_heatmap.png` - Ball position distribution across the field
- `batsman_heatmap.png` - Batsman movement patterns
- `bowler_heatmap.png` - Bowler positioning analysis
- `umpire_heatmap.png` - Umpire positioning on field

### üìÅ model_evaluation/
Model performance analysis:
- `class_performance.png` - Per-class accuracy metrics visualization
- `class_performance.csv` - Detailed performance metrics per class
- `model_metrics.csv` - Overall model evaluation metrics

### üìÅ stats/
Statistical analysis results:
- `detection_statistics.png` - Visual summary of detection counts
- `detection_summary.csv` - Aggregated detection statistics
- `ball_trajectory.csv` - Ball movement tracking data

## Missing Directories (Large Files)

### üé• annotated_videos/ (Not in Repository)
Generated annotated cricket videos with bounding boxes:
- Videos are too large for GitHub storage
- Can be generated by running `python src/detect_annotate.py`
- Contact repository owner for access to pre-processed videos

### üéØ tracked_videos/ (Not in Repository)  
Videos with multi-object tracking and player IDs:
- Generated by running `python src/track_objects.py`
- Features consistent player tracking across frames
- Available via Google Drive or can be generated locally

## Generating Missing Outputs

To generate the complete output set including videos:

1. **Setup the environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Place raw videos** in appropriate data directories:
   - `data/front view/`
   - `data/side view batsman/`
   - `data/side view bowler/`

3. **Run detection script**:
   ```bash
   python src/detect_annotate.py
   ```

4. **Run tracking script**:
   ```bash
   python src/track_objects.py
   ```

5. **Generate analytics**:
   ```bash
   python src/stats_heatmap.py
   ```

The complete outputs will be generated in their respective directories.

## File Sizes and Storage

- **Small outputs** (images, CSVs): Stored in GitHub repository
- **Large outputs** (videos): Excluded due to GitHub size limits
- **Total output size**: ~500MB+ when including all videos
- **Repository size**: ~5MB (excluding videos)

For access to complete outputs or raw video datasets, please contact the repository maintainer.
